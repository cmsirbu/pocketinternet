# Contributing to Pocket Internet

We appreciate your input! We'd like to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, be it:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. The process is explained here - [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) - and we're happy to help you get on your way to contributing to the project!

### Contribute Code

Maintainers are not allowed to directly push to master - any code changes have to be included in a PR and peer-reviewed by another maintainer. For everyone else, these are the steps in a nutshell:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Explain your changes to make the review easier!
7. Issue that pull request!

Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License. In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

### Report bugs using [GitHub's issues](https://github.com/inognet/pocketinternet/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track bugs/features/enhancements. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/inognet/pocketinternet/issues); it's that easy!

**Great bug reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    + Be specific!
    + Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Code of Conduct

- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project's maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
